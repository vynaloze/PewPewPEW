Classic space game in Android, partially voice-controlled.

-----------------------------------------------------------

It's a typical space game - you fly through galaxy and try to shoot all the upcoming meteors. BTW, there are some customisations available.

GOAL: Get a maximum score.

HOW: Fly to the left and right, shoot using your voice – the louder you shout, the bigger your bullets are.

END OF GAME: When a meteor hits the ground.

I’m planning to polish UI, add some new features, maybe use gyroscope to control movement? But it will happen someday :)
